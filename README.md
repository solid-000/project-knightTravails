# Knight Travails

As part of the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-knights-travails), this is my implementation of the Knight Travails challenge. The goal is to find the shortest path a knight can take on a standard 8Ã—8 chessboard from a given starting square to a target square, using its unique L-shaped movement.

## What I learned from this project:

- I gained a solid understanding of **Graphs**, including how to define **Vertices** and **Edges**, and how to construct them effectively.
- My knowledge of the **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** algorithm improved significantly.
- I became more comfortable using data structures like `Map` and `Set`.
- I deepened my understanding of how queuing works in BFS. Initially, I tried using recursion to empty the queue, which caused a lot of issues. Switching to iteration made the logic for finding the shortest path much clearer and finally allowed me to complete it.
- I also learned how to use the **Drag and Drop API**.

## Biggest Hurdle

One of the most frustrating challenges I faced was implementing recursion and correctly storing the queue and path the knight takes. I spent several days stuck in infinite loops and tangled logic involving paths and queues. Eventually, I decided to shift my approach from recursion to iterationâ€”and that changed everything. The solution became much clearer and easier to manage. The thing that helped me the most to overcome this project was [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWNEl4HE2OE) by Fireship.
