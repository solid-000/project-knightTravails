# Knight Travails

As part of the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-knights-travails), this is my implementation of the Knight Travails challenge. The goal is to find the shortest path a knight can take on a standard 8Ã—8 chessboard from a given starting square to a target square, using its unique L-shaped movement.
